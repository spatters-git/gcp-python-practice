As of 12/18/2018 the following scripts work:<br>
createbucket.py<br>
download_blob.py<br>
get_blob_info.py<br>
list_bucket_objects.py<br>
listbuckets.py<br>
upload_blob.py<br>
combo-storage.py - uses several methods.  This is useless, just for learning<br>
<p>
The other files are samples to work with, ignore<p>
download_blob2.py isn't working.  It attempts to get the filename to download from user input, but fails...
